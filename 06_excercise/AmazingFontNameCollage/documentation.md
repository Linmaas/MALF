## What did we do 

### Git Hub Problems Solving 

We had a lot of problems at the beginning with the windows/mac IDEs having different filetypes and folder structure. We forgot to add those to the git.ignore so we needed to do it through the console, which took us some time to figure out. We had some small merge conflicts, which we resolved after some time.

I set up the UI elements with the .gui library that comes with open frameworks. The user can enter text in an input field. If a change in text gets detected in the update function Annas part gets executed.
I had some problems with the styling of the UI elements. My override of the default parameters didn't work sadly, so it looks a bit ugly ðŸ¥²
